# West Nile Virus and St. Louis Encephalitis In California's Vulnerable Communities

West Nile Virus is pretty well known at this point but we've seen a reemergence here in California of St. Louis Encephalitis since about 2015 after a long period without detection.  In the web map linked in the data sources below we can see where WNV/SLE outbreaks may be occurring and with my project I hope to make an attempt at showing who may be affected the most by these viruses.  I would like to use CDC created layers for vulnerable census tracts in conjuction with surveillance data for WNV and SLE in California to provide finer grain detail as to what areas may be affected by these viruses instead of the more general detail we see with a point feaure displayed on a map with no other layers.

### Thoughts For Maps

1. Time series map with slider to display WNV & SLE Data.

2.  Individual maps for 2016, 2014, and 2010 showing detections overlayed with CDC layer for vulnerable census tracts.
    
3. Point in polygon analysis for these years?
     
     - Are we seeing more detections in tracts that were deemed vulnerable than in those that have not?
     - Did we see an increase in detections in vulnerable tracts for these years?
     - What's the cutoff for SVI index to determine most vulnerable?
     - Demographics of these census tracts that are seeing detections

4. Hexbin map for these years possibly?
